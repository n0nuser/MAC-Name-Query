# MAC NAME QUERY :shipit:

__USAGE__:

```bash
./mac_query.sh -f FC:A1:3E:2A:1C:33
./mac_query.sh -f FC-A1-3E-2A-1C-33
./mac_query.sh -f FC.A1.3E.2A.1C.33
./mac_query.sh -F file
```

I created this simple script as when using some nmap function or airodump-ng corresponding Vendors didn't show up.

So basically this tools satisfies the curiosity of knowing the MAC Address via CLI. :heavy_dollar_sign:

Please, don't DDos [MACVendors Page](https://macvendors.com/) by creating huge MAC lists.

However, I'll modify the script so there can be more MACs and it doesn't overload the page. :sweat_smile:
